* Main Wall
   * Individual Cubes (60x)
      * Full color LEDs
         * 4x 3W RGB LED
            * https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/2530/FD-3RGB-Y2.pdf
            * 4 * 60 = 240 LEDs
         * Power supply capable of ~2A
            * Possibly current sources (LED drivers)
            * Constant current source per LED (?)
         * 0 to 100 red, green, and blue
         * Instant digital control over levels
            * Idea: 4x Arduino Mega / 1x Raspberry Pi
            * Arduinos connected as slaves to RPi control
            * Use software PWM to alter LED intensity
         * Remote control from booth
            * Wireless or wired connection from regular PC to RPi
            * Address LEDs and alter levels
            * Levels sent to appropriate Arduino
            * Level altered by Arduino microcontroller
         * Power off backstage connectors
            * Something like 24 stage pins backstage
            * 24 * 20 A = 480 A
         * Heat sinking
         * Simple wire harness!
         * Extensive soldering
      * Wood framing
         * Around 24 feet of 2x4 lumber ( 60 * 24 = 1440 ft )
         * 12 pieces
      * Wood sheeting
         * 4 sides of exterior, 24” x 24”
         * Interior piece for LED mounting
         * Circuitry on bottom
         * Holes drilled for wires (?)
      * Clear / diffuse front
         * Plexiglas / polycarbonate
         * Diffuser paper secured behind
      * Ease of construction!
         * Few connections
         * Assembly line method
   * Bolted together
      * Short bolts / fewest possible
   * Supports in rear
      * Long 2x4s
* Scrim Walls
   * Appear like an empty frame of cubes
   * Hanging transparent scrim in center for projections
   * * Extension
   * 24 ft x 6 ft x stage height; on wheels
   * Composed of 4 - 6 ft x 6 ft x stage height blocks
   * Long-lasting, fully walkable, and only moves when desired
   * Come straight out from stage front to form long pit
* Seat Cubes
   * Provide a place for actors to sit ( & store items? ) onstage
   * Simple rectangular prisms, tall enough to sit on, with handles cut into sides
   * Possibly provide storage or ability to light up
